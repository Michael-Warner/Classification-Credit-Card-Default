# Artificial-Intelligence-for-Finance: Predicting Defaultation on Credit Cards

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to analyize a data set of a given set of credit cards and to correctly predict if a person was going to default or not on their cards based on their previous history and the history of others.

## Data Set:
The data set given was based on a [Kaggle Database](https://www.kaggle.com/mariosfish/default-of-credit-card-clients).

This data set had the following variables: history of payment, demographic factors, default payments, credit data, and bill statements. The information was taken form people based in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

The variable that was targeted was the default.payment.next.month, where 1 = default and 0 = not defaulted, which was based solely on if they defaulted or not in October of 2005. The 24 features included how much the client owed each month, what the clients payment status was, and the amount paid by the client for each month.

This given dataset simulated a real world situtation as the dataset had inaccurate labels for default payment next month, the target variable, the payment status and was not precleaned. The authors of this dataset did not explain the rules or how to read the dataset clearly. We find the rules of payment status below for etter understanding: (Or you can find the rules in the notebook with the tables as clues)

## Methods:
The methodology used was to clean the dataset, removal of NA values do a EDA

## Results:

The final objective of the project is to know and know how to put into practice the AI treatments
necessary to answer a given problem. It also requires the ability to present and comment clearly
and concisely (orally and in writing) on results tables and graphs and to take a critical look at the
overall process of processing and reporting results.

First, you must choose a study theme and a database. <br>
Second, you must choose an AI technology. <br>
Third, you must choose the story you want to tell through the study of these data. <br>
Four, You must ensure that the purpose of your study is achievable by using the variables in the
chosen database. However, you are not required to use all the variables, but you will need to select
those that will be useful to you in your study. <br>
Five. you have to provide a powerpoint document in about 8/10 slides with references.

We choose a kaggle Data base : Default of credit card clients -->
